    <p> Hello, I am Ruth and a Junior at Elon University this semester I hope to pass all my classes.  
     I have meet many other aspiring Journalist's who motivate me to work hard. 
     I am a transfer student from Guilford Technical Community College and graduated with an Associates in English. 
     My major is Journalism with a minor in Literature within the School of Communications.</p> <br>

    <p> I am planning on doing an internship this summer close to home around Greensboro, North Carolina. 
      It is difficult to find local internships that accept students with limited experience. I work as a reporter for the Elon News Network and hope to become an editor on the staff.   
     In high school, I worked on the yearbook and newspaper to improve my writing skills before college.
     Looking to the future I want to work for "The New York Times" or "The Washingtin Post."</p> <br>

    <p> I was born and raised in High Point, North Carolina. I am proud to be Latina and a first generation student. 
     As a Boricua, I love to show off the Puerto Rican flag. It's in my blood, heart, and life. 
     I hope to inspire other Latinas to chase their dreams and to rise above the challenges. 
     I grew up with four brothers and one sister so my house is always loud. 
     My dogs Bella and Leo love to play outside, eat my food, and make a mess in my room.<br>

     Michelle and Jasper are my best friends who always support me. My hobbies include reading, writing, singing, dancing, sleeping, and excercising. 
     My family is Pentacostal so I was raised in a religious home that reflect my values and beliefs in life. 
     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/@lashekinah.dejehova/"
     target="_blank"> La Shekinah De Jehovah</a> is a friendly, spanish, and small church in North Carolina.
     In the future, I wish to travel and learn about other cultures.
